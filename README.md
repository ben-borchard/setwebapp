# setwebapp

A simple webapp written using Spring Boot/SockJS/Stomp/React that allows users to create and join game instances of the card game Set.  

Currently there is lots of room for improvement, if this can be considered released it would be either alpha or beta.  Specific ideas for improvement include:

- Back end
  - Automated testing
  - Proper back end (all game data is stored in process memory right now)
  - User persistence / rejoin capability for existing games
- Front end
  - Browser cached sessions - simple rejoining of existing games
  - Rules/tutorial screen
  - More deliberate choices on UX and general styling/theming
  - Animations
